MediaTek CMDQ
===============

The Command Queue (CMDQ) is used to help read/write registers with critical
time limitation, such as updating display configuration during the vblank.
It controls Global Command Engine (GCE) hardware to achieve this requirement.
Currently, CMDQ only supports display related hardwares, but we expect it can
be extended to other hardwares for future requirements.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "mediatek,mt8173-gce"
- reg: Address range of the GCE unit
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the GCE block
- clock: Clocks according to the common clock binding
- clock-names: Must be "gce" to stand for GCE clock

Example:

	gce: gce@10212000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-gce";
		reg = <0 0x10212000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 135 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		clocks = <&infracfg CLK_INFRA_GCE>;
		clock-names = "gce";
	};
